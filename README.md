# CANCER-DIAGNOSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning project! This project aims to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer through the development of a web application powered by machine learning. Using a combination of Streamlit, Plotly, and Ensemble Learning techniques, we have created a tool that provides accurate and efficient breast cancer diagnosis.

Project Overview

Dates: May 2022 - July 2022
Technologies Used: Streamlit, Plotly, Ensemble Learning, RandomForest, SVM, KNN
About the Project

Breast cancer is a significant health concern, and early diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment. This project addresses this challenge by developing a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant medical data, and the application uses machine learning to provide a diagnosis.

Key Achievements

Web Application: We have developed and deployed a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. This interface allows users, including medical professionals and patients, to input the necessary information for diagnosis.
Machine Learning: To enhance the accuracy of our predictions, we implemented ensemble learning, which combines multiple machine learning algorithms. This approach significantly improves the overall performance of the diagnosis model.
Accuracy and Precision: The predictor model has been rigorously tested and reported to have an accuracy of 90.68% with a precision rate of 87%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying breast cancer.
Interactive Visualizations: We have showcased our expertise in data visualization by using Plotly to create interactive and informative visualizations that help users better understand the diagnosis process.
